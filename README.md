### Greetings from the Code Offices of Austin Henry Jones ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him\n
I am a full stack developer specializing in the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) stack.
In my freetime, I enjoy playing video games, reading, exercising, tinkering with my Linux system, and spending time with my family. 

### Quick trivia about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a back-end API and database for my [Flashcard-O-Matic](https://github.com/austinhjones3/flashcard-app) React.js app.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that are heavily focused on either React.js|CSS3|SASS or PostgreSQL/Knex management.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in understanding best practices for implementing user-based PostgreSQL schema.
- ðŸ’¬ I have a passion for problem-solving. Ask me about it!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinhjones3) or [Email](austin@austinjones.io)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am just as likely to listen to pop on any given day as I am hip-hop, metal, or 80's music. I have a very broad taste for music.
