## Greetings from the Code Offices of Austin Henry Jones 👋
😄 Pronouns: He/Him<br>
I am a Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript. I am competent in PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node, TypeScript, jQuery, SASS, CSS, and HTML.
In my freetime, I enjoy playing video games, reading, exercising, and spending time with my family. 

## Quick trivia about me:
- 🏆 I recently completed my final full-stack project at Thinkful, [Periodic Tables](https://github.com/austinhjones3/periodic-tables).
- 🔭 I'm working on rebuilding one of my old AJAX intro apps into a React page, [Get-Coins](https://github.com/austinhjones3/get-coins).
- 🤔 Technologies that are on my learning radar include: GraphQL, TypeScript, Python & Django, Jest, and React Query.
- 📖 I'm currently learning TypeScript and more React Hooks.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am just as likely to listen to pop on any given day as I am hip-hop, metal, or 80's music. I have a very broad taste for music.
- 🤓 A nerdier fun fact: I have a hawkeye for syntax and logic errors. I find them very quickly.
