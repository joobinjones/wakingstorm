## Hey, I'm Austin JonesðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer currently employed with Netchex, Inc. I am a Certified ScrumMaster, and I believe in the power of collaboration. I'm always looking for new ways to solve complex problems. I try my best to find a good balance between sustainable solutions and timely delivery. I believe in empowering and trusting people to do their best, and I seek the same from those managing me. Delivering the software isn't enough: engineers need to be happy and living a balanced life, the solutions need to be sustainable and well-tested, and the user experience needs to be more intuitive than the requirements say it should be ;)
