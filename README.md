## Greetings from the Code Offices of Austin Henry Jones 👋
😄 Pronouns: He/Him<br>
I am a Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript. I prefer working in the back-end with technologies such as PostgreSQL, Knex.js, Node.js, and Express.js. I am also competent in front-end technologies such as React.js, CSS3, and HTML5.
In my freetime, I enjoy playing video games, reading, exercising, tinkering with my Linux system, and spending time with my family. 

## Quick trivia about me:
- 🏆 I recently built an algorithm timing tool, [Algo Speedometer](https://github.com/austinhjones3/algo-speedometer). It is far from perfect, but it will get closer and closer very soon!
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my final full-stack project at Thinkful, [Periodic Tables](https://github.com/austinhjones3/periodic-tables).
- 🤔 Technologies that are on my learning radar include: C# | ASP.NET | .NET Core, Python | Django, PHP | Laravel, Object-Oriented React, Angular.
- 📖 I'm currently learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) alongside Java 11!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am just as likely to listen to pop on any given day as I am hip-hop, metal, or 80's music. I have a very broad taste for music.
- 🤓 A nerdier fun fact: I have a hawkeye for syntax and logic errors. I find them very quickly.
